1) Remove any weeds or crop residues from the field to reduce competition for nutrients and water.

2)Test the soil to determine its nutrient content and pH level. 
This will help you determine what amendments are necessary for optimal crop growth.

3)Add organic matter, such as compost or manure, to improve soil structure and increase water-holding capacity. 
Spread the organic matter evenly over the field, and then till it into the top few inches of soil.

4)Use a disc harrow or plow to break up any large clumps of soil and create a uniform seedbed. Avoid over-tilling, which can lead to soil compaction and reduce water infiltration.

5)Level the field to ensure even water distribution and prevent erosion. Use a box blade or land plane to smooth out any bumps or depressions.

6)Create raised beds if necessary, especially in poorly-drained soils. Raised beds improve drainage and soil aeration, and can increase crop yields.
